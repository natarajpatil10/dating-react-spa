			<p>
				If you follow the Bible closely, you will notice that there are no clear instructions on how to find your soul mate. However, you might notice that the way dating or even courting happens
				today is quite different from how it happened in the Biblical age. Back then, families of young men and women used to select their partners for them. Even today, this practice exists in
				certain countries, although the common notion is a bit different.
			</p>
			<p className="mb-5">
				Nowadays with modern and evolving communities, online dating is a popular option. With a large and ever growing database of Christian members, you can meet your partner online and check if
				he/she shares your interests.

				Well, when it comes to religious dating, you might have second thoughts. However, if you choose the online dating, you’d be surprised to find a lot of likeminded people. Just make sure you
				make your preferences known before you go out for an offline date.
			</p>
			<h4>Do I Have Options?</h4>
			<p className="mb-5">
				Contrary to the popular belief, when you are choosing a partner through an online dating site, you have many options available. You can scroll through different sites and choose the one you
				prefer. Additionally, you can also go through websites, which cater only to the Christian folk. Certain sites like eHarmony also allow you to specify denominations. Other websites come with a
				compatibility score, which you can use to check if your preferences match or not.
			</p>
			<h4>What Is The Safest Method?</h4>
			<p className="mb-5">
				When it comes to dating, you have to opt for the try and buy option. Even in real life, you might come across someone who is good to talk to, but not good enough to be chosen as a life
				partner. The compatibility of your partner and you depends on your level of understanding, which you need to figure out after a couple of dates. At the end of the day when you understand each
				other, you’d have lesser problems in life.
