			Dating has indeed changed in the current era of COVID-19 and social distancing, but your search for a relationship doesn't have to stop. In fact, online dating sites and apps are the perfect
			solution to dating responsibly and finding someone who you share interests with for a short fling or a long-term, serious relationship. Cuddling up in bed watching Netflix when it’s cold outside
